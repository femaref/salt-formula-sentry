Sentry formula
==============

Sentry is a realtime event logging and aggregation platform. At its core it
specializes in monitoring errors and extracting all the information needed to
do a proper post-mortem without any of the hassle of the standard user
feedback loop.

Itâ€™s important to note that Sentry should not be thought of as a log stream,
but as an event aggregator. It fits somewhere in-between a simple metrics
solution (such as Graphite) and a full-on log stream aggregator (like
Logstash).

Standalone server
